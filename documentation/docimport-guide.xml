        <title>Introducing Akeeba DocImport</title>

        <para>Akeeba DocImport is a component which allows you to offer
        interactive on-line documentation from DocBook 5 XML source files. The
        idea is that you just need to upload your DocBook XML files and
        associated media files (e.g. images) in a subdirectory of the media
        directory and let the component convert them to HTML articles. The
        generated HTML articles are managed by DocImport itself.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Akeeba DocImport is a developer's product. It may be difficult
          for end users and site integrators to use. That's by design!
          Frankly, unless you are a hardcore developer, what are you doing
          messing around with DocBook XML? It's not like it is the easiest
          publishing format on this planet. If you are looking for something
          very easy to use to publish articles or structured FAQs on your site
          please look at one of the FAQ or CCK extensions for Joomla! at the
          Joomla! Extensions Directory.</para>

        <title>Installing Akeeba DocImport</title>

        <para>Installing <application>Akeeba DocImport</application> is no
        different than installing any other <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
        extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions for
        installing <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> extensions on the <link
        xlink:href="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/">official
        help page</link>. Throughout this chapter we assume that you are
        familiar with these instructions and we will try not to duplicate
        them.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Installing or manually updating the component</title>

          <para>Just like with most Joomla! extensions there are two ways to
          install or manually update Akeeba DocImport on your site:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Upload and install. That's the typical extension
              installation method for Joomla! extensions. It rarely
              fails.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Manual installation. This is the hardest, but virtually
              fail-safe, installation method.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Please note that installing and updating Akeeba DocImport (and
          almost all Joomla! extensions) is actually the same thing. If you
          want to update Akeeba DocImport please remember that you <emphasis
          role="bold">MUST NOT</emphasis> uninstall it before installing the
          new version! When you uninstall Akeeba DocImport you will lose all
          your settings. This is definitely something you do not want to
          happen! Instead, simply install the new version on top of the old
          one. Joomla! will figure out that you are doing an update and will
          treat it as such, automatically.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>If you find that after installing or updating Akeeba
            DocImport it is missing some features or doesn't work, please try
            installing the same version a second time, without uninstalling
            the component. The reason is that very few times the Joomla!
            extensions installer infrastructure gets confused and fails to
            copy some files or entire folders. By repeating the installation
            you force it to copy the missing files and folders, solving the
            problem.</para>
          </tip>

          <section xml:id="installing-upload">
            <title>Upload and install.</title>

            <para>You can download the latest installation packages our site's
            <link
            xlink:href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/downloads/docimport.html">download
            page for Akeeba DocImport</link>. Please note that the latest
            version is always on top. If you have an older version of Joomla!
            or PHP please consult our <link
            xlink:href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/compatibility.html">Compatibility
            page</link> to find the version of Akeeba DocImport compatible
            with your Joomla! and PHP versions. In either case click on the
            version you want to download and install.</para>

            <para>Click on the Akeeba DocImport item to download the ZIP
            installation package.</para>

            <para>All Akeeba DocImport installation packages contain the
            component and all of its associated extensions. Installing it will
            install all of these items automatically. It can also be used to
            upgrade Akeeba DocImport; just install it
            <emphasis>without</emphasis> uninstalling the previous
            release.</para>

            <para>In any case, do not extract the ZIP files yet!</para>

            <warning>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Attention Mac OS X users</emphasis>!
              Safari, the default web server provided to you by Apple, is
              automatically extracting the ZIP file into a directory and
              removes the ZIP file. In order to install the extension through
              Joomla!'s extensions installer you must select that directory,
              right-click on it and select Compress to get a ZIP file of its
              contents. This behaviour was changed in Mac OS X Mountain Lion,
              but people upgrading from older versions of Mac OS X (Mac OS X
              Lion and earlier) will witness the old, automatic ZIP
              extraction, behaviour.</para>
            </warning>

            <para>Log in to your site's administrator section. Click on
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
            link on the top menu. If you are on Joomla! 3.x please click on
            the <guilabel>Upload Package File</guilabel> tab. Locate the
            <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> button next to the <guilabel>Package
            File</guilabel> (Joomla! 2.5, 3.0 and 3.1) or <guilabel>Extension
            package file</guilabel> (Joomla! 3.2 and later) field. Locate the
            installation ZIP file you had previously downloaded and select it.
            Back to the page, click on the <guibutton>Upload &amp;
            Install</guibutton> button. After a short while,
            <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> will tell you that the component
            has been installed.</para>

            <warning>
              <para>Akeeba DocImport is a big extension (over 2Mb for the
              Professional release). Some servers do not allow you to upload
              files that big. If this is the case you can try the <link
              linkend="installation-manual">Manual installation</link> or ask
              your host to follow <link
              xlink:href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/documentation/troubleshooter/abinstallation.html">our
              installation troubleshooting instructions</link> under "You get
              an error about the package not being uploaded to the
              server".</para>

              <para>If you have WAMPServer (or any other prepackaged local
              server), please note that its default configuration does not
              allow files over 2Mb to be uploaded. To work around that you
              will need to modify your php.ini and restart the server. On
              WAMPserver left-click on the WAMP icon (the green W), click on
              <guimenu>PHP</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>php.ini</guimenuitem>. Find
              the line beginning with <code>upload_max_filesize</code>. Change
              it so that it reads:</para>

              <programlisting>upload_max_filesize = 6M</programlisting>

              <para>Save this file. Now, left-click on the WAMP icon, click on
              <guimenu>Apache</guimenu>, <guisubmenu>Service</guisubmenu>,
              <guimenuitem>Restart Service</guimenuitem> and you can now
              install the component. Editing the <filename>php.ini</filename>
              file should also work on all other servers, local and live
              alike.</para>
            </warning>

            <para>If the installation did not work, please take a look at

            <para>Click on the Akeeba DocImport item to download the ZIP

            <para>All Akeeba DocImport installation packages contain the

            install all of these items automatically. It can also be used to

            <emphasis>without</emphasis> uninstalling the previous
            release.</para>

            <para>Before doing anything else, you have to extract the
            installation ZIP file in a subdirectory named
            <filename>akeeba</filename> on your local PC. Then, upload the
            entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary directory. At
            this point, there should be a subdirectory named
            <filename>akeeba</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
            which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

            <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
            located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global
            Configuration</guimenuitem>, click on the
            <guilabel>Server</guilabel> tab and take a look at the
            <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel> setting. The default
            setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory under your
            site's root. Rarely, especially on automated installations using
            Fantastico, this might have been assigned the system-wide
            <filename>/tmp</filename> directory. In this case, please consult
            your host for instructions on how to upload files inside this
            directory, or about changing your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
            temporary directory back to the default location and making it
            writable.</para>

            <para>Assuming that you are past this uploading step, click on
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
            link on the top menu. If you are on Joomla! 3.x please click on
            the <guilabel>Install from Directory</guilabel> tab. Locate the
            <guibutton>Install Directory</guibutton> edit box. It is already
            filled in with the absolute path to your temporary directory, for
            example <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp</filename>. Please append
            <filename>/akeeba</filename> to it. In our example, it should look
            something like <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp/akeeba</filename>.
            Then, click on the <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.</para>

            <para>If you still can't install Akeeba DocImport and you are

        <bridgehead>Updating automatically with the Joomla! extensions update

        <para>Akeeba DocImport can be updated just like any other Joomla!
        extension, using the Joomla! extensions update feature. Joomla! is
        responsible for finding the updates, downloading them and installing
        them on your server. You can access the extensions update feature in
        two different ways:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>From the icon your Joomla! administrator control panel page.
            On Joomla! 3 you will find the icon in the left-hand sidebar,
            under the <guilabel>Maintenance</guilabel> header. It has an icon
            which looks like an empty star. On Joomla! 2.5 you will find it in
            the main area of the control panel page, under <guilabel>Quick
            Icons</guilabel>. When there are updates found for any of your
            extensions you will see the <guilabel>Updates are
            available</guilabel> message. Clicking on it will get you to the
            Update page of Joomla! Extensions Manager.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>From the top menu of your Joomla! administrator click on
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Extensions
            Manager</guimenuitem>. From that page click on the
            <guilabel>Update</guilabel> tab found in the left-hand sidebar on
            Joomla! 3 and the top navigation bar in Joomla! 2.5. Clicking on
            it will get you to the Update page of Joomla! Extensions
            Manager.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>If you do not see the updates try clicking on the
        <guibutton>Find Updates</guibutton> button in the toolbar. If you do
        not see the updates still you may want to wait up to 24 hours before
        retrying. This has to do with the way the update CDN works and how
        Joomla! caches the update information. Unfortunately we can't do
        anything about it, especially in Joomla! 3 (there is no way to
        forcibly clean the updates cache).</para>

        <para>As noted in the <link linkend="installing">installation
        section</link>, installing and updating Akeeba DocImport is actually
        the same thing. If the automatic update using Joomla!'s extensions
        update feature does not work, please install the update manually
        following the instructions in the <link
        linkend="installing">installation section of this
        documentation</link>.</para>

        <important>
          <para>When installing an update manually you MUST NOT uninstall your
          existing version of Akeeba DocImport. Uninstalling Akeeba DocImport
          will always remove all your settings. You definitely not want that
          to happen!</para>

        <para>On older versions of Akeeba DocImport there is a different
        update method, if your server supports it. It is called the "Live
        Update" feature. Whenever you visit the Akeeba DocImport Control
        Panel, it will automatically check for the existence of an updated
        version and it will notify you. Clicking on the notification allows
        you to perform a live update without further interaction. Do note that
        if your server is protected by a firewall you'll have to enable port
        80 and 443 TCP traffic to www.akeebabackup.com and
        cdn.akeebabackup.com for this feature to work properly.</para>

          <para>This feature is only available in the Professional
          release.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Since March 2014 all of our software uses Joomla! Extensions
        Update to determine if there is an extension available and to let you
        install it. None of our own code is involved in the update
        provisioning and installation process. However, this means that you
        need to either log in to your site often to see if there are updates
        available or subscribe to a third party service which will do that for
        you. The former is inconvenient when you have multiple sites, the
        latter is expensive.</para>

        <para>This is where our CLI update script come into the big picture.
        This script will ask Joomla! to tell it if there is an update
        available for our component. If there is, it can do either (or both)
        of these actions:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Send an email notification to the email address you have
            specified.</para>

          this script exempt from our support policy. IF YOU DECIDE TO USE
          THIS SCRIPT TO INSTALL UPDATES OF OUR SOFTWARE AUTOMATICALLY YOU ARE
          DOING SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.</para>

        <para>Joomla! currently does not provide a way to indicate the
        stability status (alpha, beta, RC, stable), Joomla! version
        compatibility and PHP version compatibility status of an available
        update. This means that in the future you might end up having the
        automatic update CLI script install a version of our software which is
        unstable or incompatible with your version of PHP or Joomla!. We
        strongly recommend you to check the Compatibility page on our site to
        determine which version is compatible with your site.</para>

        <para>Furthermore, Joomla! does not provide a rollback feature for
        failed updates. If for any reason the update process (which is handled
        by Joomla! itself, not our own code, therefore outside our control)
        fails while it is copying the component's files you will end up with a
        partially upgrade component. This can lead to functional issues or
        even inability to access your site.</para>

        <para>Finally, even if you have Akeeba Backup Professional, System
        Restore Points CAN NOT be taken when installing an update through the
        CLI update script. If the update fails you are really left with no

        <para>DocImport is used to generate articles from categories. Each
        category either contains a single DocBook XML book or one or more
        DocBook XML articles.</para>

        <para>Each category has its own folder under the
        <filename>media/com_docimport</filename> directory. Since DocImport
        1.0.9 each category can be its own folder under the
        <filename>media/com_docimport/books</filename> directory for better
        organisation. In the root of each category directory you place the XML
        file(s) of your DocBook XML book or articles. Images used in your book
        must be located under the <filename>images</filename> subdirectory.
        The intermediate results of the DocBook to HTML conversion will be
        located in the <filename>output</filename> subdirectory. If DocImport
        cannot create this directory it will not be able to generate the
        articles. In this case, please create this subdirectory manually and
        make sure that it is writable by Joomla!.</para>

        <para>Whenever you upload a new XML file or an updated version of an
        XML file to a category you need to rebuild the articles of that
        category. The rebuild process will convert your XML file(s) into HTML
        and then create or update articles. The rebuild process does not run
        automatically. You have to either launch it manually from the back-end
        of the component or run it periodically by means of a CRON job using
        the provided CLI script.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Uploading of new XML files and images is supposed to occur
          outside of the component, e.g by FTP or using Joomla!'s Media
          Manager. There is no facility to upload files from within the
          DocImport component.</para>
        </note>

        <para>DocImport is designed to create beautiful, sensible URLs without
        the use of a third party SEF component. It does so using its own
        router. Due to the complexity of the algorithm, building and parsing
        the URLs is a resource intensive process. In order to speed up the
        process DocImport uses its own SEF URL cache. If you get strange
        results after rebuilding a category you can always purge it so that
        DocImport can regenerate it.</para>

        where you manage documentation categories and regenerate their
        contents (articles). It is a standard Joomla! grid view, with the
        following columns:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Up/Down Arrow</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>(Joomla! 3.0 and later) When you click on it you enable
              the drag &amp; drop reordering support. When the handle on this
              column is solid black you can drag it and reorder the
              categories.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>That's the numeric ID of the category. Normally you won't
              need it anywhere.</para>

            <term>Status</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>There are two icons here. The left one will tell you if
              the category is up to date. An X in an orange background means
              that the articles should be rebuilt. A tickbox in a green
              background means that the articles are up-to-date. DocImport
              determines that by comparing the date of your XML file(s)
              against the last date/time it built the articles for this
              category.</para>

              <para>The second one is a actually a button. When you click on
              it DocImport will (re)build the articles for this category off
              the XML source. You have to do that every time you create a new
              category or upload a new version of your XML
              documentation.</para>

              example, to have your documentation in English, French and
              German with only the properly localised version shown to
              visitors viewing your site in each language, i.e. English to

              Please note that DocImport tries to reorder the articles
              automatically, based on their ordering in your book's index page

        <para>DocImport offers a command line (CLI) script which allows you to
        automate the category rebuild using standard CRON jobs.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Some hosts offer "CRON jobs" which allow you to enter a URL
          which will be accessed periodically. This is NOT a CRON job. It is a
          "fake" CRON job and will not work with DocImport.</para>
        </important>

        <para>All <application>DocImport</application> releases include the
        file <filename>cli/docimport-update.php</filename>, which can be run
        from the command-line PHP interface (PHP CLI). It is a self-contained,
        native documentation rebuild tool for your
        <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> site, even if your web server is
        down!</para>

        <para>In order to schedule a documentation, you will have to use the
        following command line to your host's CRON interface:</para>

        <programlisting><replaceable>/usr/local/bin/php</replaceable> <replaceable>/home/USER/webroot</replaceable>/cli/docimport-update.php</programlisting>

        <para>where <replaceable>/usr/local/bin/php</replaceable> is the path
        to your PHP CLI executable and
        <replaceable>/home/USER/webroot</replaceable> is the absolute path to
        your web site's root. You can get this information from your
        host.</para>

              cPanel). Do note the path for the PHP command line executable:
              <filename>/usr/bin/php5-cli</filename>. This is the default
              location of the correct executable file for cPanel 11 and later.
              Your host may use a different path to the executable. If the
              command never runs, ask them. We can't help you with that; only
              those who have set up the server know the changes they have made

      <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
      assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
      or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
      Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
      to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.</para>

      <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
      works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
      complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
      designed for free software.</para>

      <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">1. APPLICABILITY AND
      DEFINITIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
      that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
      work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
      to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
      is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
      distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
      law.</para>

      <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
      Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

      <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
      a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
      commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
      them.</para>

      <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
      section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
      allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
      Sections then there are none.</para>

      <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
      Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
      words.</para>

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
      is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
      this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
      such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
      section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

      <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">2. VERBATIM COPYING</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
      3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
      and you may publicly display copies.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</bridgehead>

      <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">4. MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
      under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
      release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
      distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
      possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
          section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
          version if the original publisher of that version gives
          permission.</simpara>

          Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
          Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document,
          create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
          Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
          Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
          Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
          and likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
          "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that
          was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
          the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
          permission.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
          "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in
          the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
      appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
      copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
      of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
      of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
      titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

      <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
      been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.</para>

      <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
      and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
      list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
      Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
      arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
      cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
      made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
      another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
      the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

      <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
      License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
      assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
      this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
      list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

      <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
      multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
      copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
      different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
      at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
      publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
      in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

      <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
      Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
      "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
      delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
      documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
      of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
      included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
      License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.</para>

      <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
      distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
      copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
      License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
      document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
      WORKS</bridgehead>

      <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
      separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
      rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.</para>

      <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
      copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
      the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
      that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
      equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
      they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

      <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
      distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
      Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
      permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
      translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
      original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
      translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
      Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
      the original English version of this License and the original versions
      of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
      translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
      disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

      <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
      Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
      title.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
      except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
      LICENSE</bridgehead>

      <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
      the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
      detail to address new problems or concerns. See <link
      xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">
      http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</link> .</para>

      <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
      number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
      this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
      of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
      or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
      Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
      number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
      as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
      documents</bridgehead>

      <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
      of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
      license notices just after the title page:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.</para>

        <para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
        document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
        Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
        Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section
        entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
      Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.</para>

      <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
      their use in free software.</para>
